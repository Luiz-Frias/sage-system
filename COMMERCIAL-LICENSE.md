# SAGE System Commercial License

## Why Commercial Licensing?

The SAGE System is available under AGPL-3.0 for open source use, which requires:
- All derivative works to be open source
- All network services using the code to provide source access
- Full compliance with copyleft requirements

If your use case doesn't align with AGPL-3.0 requirements, you need a commercial license.

## When Do You Need a Commercial License?

You need a commercial license if you plan to:

### ✅ Definitely Need Commercial License
- Integrate SAGE into proprietary/closed-source software
- Use SAGE in SaaS products without providing full source code
- Redistribute SAGE as part of commercial products
- Modify SAGE for internal commercial use without open-sourcing changes
- Use SAGE in consulting or services where client code remains proprietary

### ⚠️ Probably Need Commercial License
- Enterprise internal use where AGPL compliance is challenging
- Government or defense applications with classification requirements
- Integration with existing proprietary systems
- White-label or OEM products

### ❌ Don't Need Commercial License

- Public repositories with AGPL-compliant code

# SAGE System
**Supervisor Agent-Generated Engineering**

A revolutionary multi-agent code generation system that orchestrates specialized agents to build modern software applications systematically.

## 🚀 What is SAGE?

SAGE represents a paradigm shift in software development:
- **Supervisor-Orchestrated**: You act as the persistent manager coordinating multiple specialized agents
- **Wave-Based Execution**: Systematic progress with quality gates at each development phase
- **Learning System**: Captures patterns from successful implementations to improve future builds
- **Language-Agnostic Core**: Pluggable language and domain modules
- **Agent Communication**: Sophisticated protocol ensures agents coordinate without conflicts

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core System (`/core/`)
- **Configuration**: System-wide settings and parameters
- **Engine**: Wave orchestration, parallelization rules, learning system
- **Communication**: Agent messaging protocol and conflict resolution
- **Registry**: Agent capabilities, language features, available tools

### Domain Modules (`/domains/`)
- **Insurance**: P&C insurance with underwriting, claims, rating
- **E-commerce**: Online retail with inventory, orders, payments
- **SaaS**: Software-as-a-Service patterns and templates

### Language Plugins (`/languages/`)
- **Python**: Async patterns, FastAPI, type safety
- **TypeScript**: React patterns, state management, UI components
- **Rust**: Systems patterns, memory safety, performance
